While Yup is more popular, Zod generally has stricter TypeScript types and is well-loved by many React developers.</li><li><strong>HouseForm is field-focused:</strong> Formik requires you to pass <a href="https://formik.org/docs/api/withFormik#validationschema-schema--props-props--schema" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a <code>validationSchema</code> property</a> to validate the whole form with Yup. HouseForm, on the other hand, allows you to validate each field individually <a href="/reference.html#field-props">using inline properties associated with the field itself</a>.</li><li><strong>HouseForm is flexible:</strong> While <a href="https://formik.org/docs/api/withFormik#validateonblur-boolean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Formik forces you to choose between <code>onChange</code>, <code>onSubmit</code>, and <code>onMount</code> validation</a>, HouseForm allows you to choose which validation to use for each field.</li><li><strong>HouseForm is actively maintained:</strong> As of this writing, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Formik has not seen a package publish in nearly 3 years</a>, despite <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/pulls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">many open community PRs</a>. There doesn&#39;t appear to be a clear community-led fork of Formik to help supplement this, either. HouseForm, on the other hand, is being actively maintained and is actively used in production today.</li><li><strong>Formik is fast:</strong> It&#39;s worth mentioning that HouseForm is not yet as performant as Formik. In general, <a href="https://github.com/crutchcorn/houseform/tree/main/lib/benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our benchmarks</a> show that Formik is ~1.25x faster at most operations when rendering 1,000 form fields. However, HouseForm is still more than fast enough for most use cases. In those same benchmarks we&#39;re able to do an initial render of those 1,000 fields in ~80ms.</li><li><strong>Formik is popular:</strong> As of time of writing, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Formik has 2 million downloads a week</a>.
